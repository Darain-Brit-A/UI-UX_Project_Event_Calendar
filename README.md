- **Recurring Events**: Option to set events to repeat annually, ideal for birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays.
- **View Event Details**: Click on an event in the calendar to open a detailed modal view.
- **Delete Events**: Remove events with a confirmation step from the details view.
- **Go to Date**: A date picker allows you to jump directly to any month and year.
- **View All Events**: A dedicated modal that displays a chronological list of all saved events.
- **Persistent Storage**: All events are saved in the browser's Local Storage, so your data persists between sessions.
